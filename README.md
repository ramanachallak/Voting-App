### The voting process has always been an arduous process to organize. Depending on the location, voters find it difficult at times to not only vote, but also register to vote. There are long lines, voter suppression tactics that force people to commute long distances to vote, and many more issues with the traditional voting process. As a result we've built a blockchain voting process that solves the majority of these issues. Making it completely digital and trustless, decentralized, and secure. We believe the blockchain is a perfect tool for a voting system.

# Final Takeaways and Improvements
- UI component of the app can be be made responsive, to enable usage across mobile devices.
- Possible enhancement can be deploying the application as a mobile app.
- Currently the app stores Candidate information on the browser's local storage. This can either be encrypted or data can be stored on the blockchain itself.
